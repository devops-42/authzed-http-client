# ðŸš€ Introduction

The repository provides a building facade for generating HTTP clients for the [SpiceDB](https://authzed.com/spicedb)
REST API. It currently is in incubating/showcase state. The target is to provide pre-packaged HTTP clients for
various languages. The build infrastructure is backed by the [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
composed around [OpenAPI Generator CLI]().
