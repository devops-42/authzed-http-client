# üë©‚ÄçüíªBuilding locally

The full automation flow is not yet clear. For the moment, a simple shell script is provided to
build the client(s) locally using a Docker based stack.

```bash
# run the client generation locally
# make sure you run the command from the project root directory
./src/local-builds/generate.sh
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The local build approach is mostly going to be archived once the automated workflow(s) are fully complete.
