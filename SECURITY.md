# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please DO NOT disclose it publicly until we’ve had a chance to fix it. 
Please don’t report security vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead please report found vulnerabilities 
to [EWERK Digital GmbH](https://ewerk.com) in a secure and sensitive fashion.

The project maintainers will be contacted and will try to take care of the issue.

At the moment, we cannot make any promises on how backward compatible these fixes will be, as the project heavily 
relies on downstream dependencies
