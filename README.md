# authzed-http-client

[![main](https://github.com/ewerk/authzed-http-client/actions/workflows/main-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ewerk/authzed-http-client/actions/workflows/main-build.yml)

## üöÄ Introduction

The repository provides a building facade for generating HTTP clients for the [SpiceDB](https://authzed.com/spicedb)
REST API.
It currently is in incubating/showcase state.
The target is to provide pre-packaged HTTP clients for various languages.
The build infrastructure is backed by the [OpenAPI Generator CLI]().

---

## Supported languages

The following languages are currently supported.

- [x] `Java`
- [ ] `Typescript`
- [ ] `Python`
- [ ] `C#`

---

## üë©‚ÄçüíªLocal builds

The full automation flow is not yet clear. For the moment, a simple shell script is provided to
build the client(s) locally using a Docker based stack.

```bash
# run the client generation locally
./local-build.sh
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è The local build approach is mostly going to be archived once the automated workflow is fully complete.

---

## ü§ñ Automated builds

The builds of the HTTP clients in various languages is purely implemented by using GitHub
action workflows, mainly backed
by [openapi-generators/openapitools-generator-action@v1](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/generate-client-library-w-the-openapitools-generator).

### Java

#### Snapshots

The Java client library build from the `main` branch are deployed to the GitHub Packages repo.
The snapshots can be seen within
the [packages view](https://github.com/orgs/ewerk/packages?repo_name=authzed-http-client) on GiHub.

The snapshots should be immediately available to your build, e.g. by using:

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ewerk.spicedb</groupId>
  <artifactId>authzed-http-client-restclient</artifactId>
  <version>17-v1.1.0-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Releases

- [ ] t.b.d.

#### Usage

The client can be pretty much used as any HTTP client generated by OpenAPI generator.

‚ÑπÔ∏è The following example is taken from the generated coed and might be outdated,
as the generated `README.md` is not part of the Java packages.

```java

import com.ewerk.spicedb.authzed.http.*;
import com.ewerk.spicedb.authzed.http.auth.*;
import com.ewerk.spicedb.authzed.http.model.*;
import com.ewerk.spicedb.authzed.http.client.ExperimentalServiceApi;

public class ExperimentalServiceApiExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var defaultClient = new ApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("http://localhost");

    var apiInstance = new ExperimentalServiceApi(defaultClient);
    var body = new V1BulkCheckPermissionRequest(); // V1BulkCheckPermissionRequest | NOTE: Deprecated now that BulkCheckPermission has been promoted to the stable API as \"CheckBulkPermission\".

    try {
      var result = apiInstance.experimentalServiceBulkCheckPermission(body);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (HttpStatusCodeException cause) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling ExperimentalServiceApi#experimentalServiceBulkCheckPermission");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + cause.getStatusCode().value());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + cause.getResponseBodyAsString());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + cause.getResponseHeaders());
      cause.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

```
