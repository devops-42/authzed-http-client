## üöÄ Introduction

The repository provides a building facade for generating HTTP clients for the [SpiceDB](https://authzed.com/spicedb)
REST API.
It currently is in incubating/showcase state.
The target is to provide pre-packaged HTTP clients for various languages.
The build infrastructure is backed by the [OpenAPI Generator CLI]().

---

## Supported languages

The following languages are currently supported.

- [x] `Java`
- [ ] `Typescript`
- [ ] `Python`
- [ ] `C#`

## üë©‚ÄçüíªLocal builds

The full automation flow is not yet clear. For the moment, a simple shell script is provided to
build the client(s) locally using a Docker based stack.

```bash
# run the client generation locally
./local-build.sh
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è The local build approach is mostly going to be archived once the automated workflow is fully complete.

---

## ü§ñ Automated builds

The builds of the HTTP clients in various languages is purely implemented by using GitHub
action workflows, main backed by [openapi-generators/openapitools-generator-action@v1](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/generate-client-library-w-the-openapitools-generator).
